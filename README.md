## Introduction

Bird species classification using deep learning models is an innovative approach to automate the identification of avian species from images. This field of research aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision to accurately and efficiently recognize and categorize various bird species. By harnessing large datasets and advanced deep learning architectures, this technology holds great promise in aiding wildlife monitoring, ecological research, and conservation efforts.

## Background

Bird species classification using deep learning models has emerged as a promising approach to automate the identification of avian species from images. Traditional methods of bird identification rely on manual observation and expert knowledge, making them labor-intensive and limited in scope. However, with the advent of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is an opportunity to leverage large-scale datasets and advanced algorithms to accurately recognize and categorize various bird species based on their visual characteristics.

## Problem Definition

The project aims to address the limitations of traditional bird species identification methods by developing a deep learning-based classification system. The key challenges include variations in lighting, poses, and background clutter, which can affect the accuracy of classification.

## Objectives

1. Dataset Collection and Curation
2. Model Exploration and Selection
3. Model Training and Optimization
4. Performance Evaluation
5. Error Analysis and Improvement

## Methodology/Procedure

### MobileNet V2

#### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

The project begins with data preprocessing, where the training, validation, and test datasets are prepared. Data augmentation techniques, such as random horizontal flipping, random rotation, and random brightness adjustments, are applied to increase dataset diversity.

#### Model Creation

The classification model is created using MobileNet V2 as the base model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The base model's top layers are excluded, and additional layers are added for multi-class classification.

#### Model Training and Fine-Tuning

The model is initially trained with frozen layers of the base model. Afterward, fine-tuning is performed by unfreezing some layers to further improve performance.

#### Evaluation

The model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure accuracy and other relevant metrics.

### ResNet-50V2

#### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

Similar data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are applied as in the MobileNet V2 approach.

#### Model Creation

The ResNet-50V2 architecture is used as the base model, and additional layers are added for classification.

#### Model Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset to assess performance.

## Results and Discussion

### MobileNet V2

- Achieved test accuracy: 94.74%
